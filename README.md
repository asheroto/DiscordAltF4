# DiscordAltF4
When pressing Alt+F4 on Discord it will end program instead of just closing the window. This script fixes that.

# Install
[Download](https://github.com/asheroto/DiscordAltF4/releases/latest/download/DiscordAltF4.exe) and move it into your Startup folder. Then run it.

To get to the Startup folder, press Win+R which will open Run, then type `shell:startup` and press enter. The Startup folder contains programs that will automatically run when you log on.

# Usage
With the Discord window active, press Alt+F4. It should close the window instead of ending the program.

# Troubleshooting
If Alt+F4 is ending Discord even though `DiscordAltF4.exe` is running:
- Open Discord and go to User Settings (the gear next to your name), Windows Settings, and enable Minimize to Tray, then try it again
- If it's still not working, make sure you are **not** running Discord as Administrator
- If it's still not working, [check Issues](https://github.com/asheroto/DiscordAltF4/issues) and if you don't find your answer, make a new issue
